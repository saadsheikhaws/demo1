To start the workshop, follow one of the following depending on whether you are...

* ...[running the workshop on your own (in your own account)](/introduction/tracing), or
* ...[attending an AWS hosted event (using AWS provided hashes)](/introduction/metrics)

Once you have completed with either setup, continue with [**Create a Workspace**](./workspace/workspace)
